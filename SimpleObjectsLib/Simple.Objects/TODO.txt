Implement IpropertyModel interface on ServerPropertyInfo
Manager/SimpleObjectManager.cs ValidateDelete(SimpleObject simpleObject, IDictionary<SimpleObject, TransactionRequestAction> transactionRequests)
	Implement CancelDelete with restoring all RemoveAllRelatedObjectsFromAllRelatedObjectCaches to its original state (ChangeContainter -> reject changes)
	Call SimpleObject.RemoveAllRelatedObjectsFromAllRelatedObjectCaches before transactiona validation and if CancelDelete is called restore related realations to its original state after calling DelereRequested
	Than SimpleObject.RemoveAllRelatedObjectsFromAllRelatedObjectCaches should not be called after transaction succeded. The Rollback transaction should do that
